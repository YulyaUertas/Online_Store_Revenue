# Testing-hypotheses-for-increasing-revenue-in-an-online-store-evaluating-the-results-of-an-A-B-test

Using data from the online store to prioritize hypotheses and evaluate the results of A/B testing using various methods.

Hypotheses were prioritized using the ICE and RICE frameworks. Then, an analysis of the results of the A/B test was conducted, 
cumulative revenue and average order value (AOV) graphs were plotted, conversion rates were compared between groups,
and statistical significance of differences in conversions and AOV was calculated using both raw and cleaned data. 
Based on the analysis, a decision was made to discontinue the test as it was deemed impractical.
